## 🔢 Sorting

1. <b>Selection Sort:</b> Select minimum and swap. Time Complexity- O(n2): Worst/Average/Best Case.

2. <b>Bubble Sort:</b> Push the maximum to last by adjacent swapping. Time Complexity- O(n2): Worst/Average Case, O(n): Best Case.

3. <b>Insertion Sort:</b> Takes an element and place it in its correct position. Time Complexity- O(n2): Worst/Average Case, O(n): Best Case.

4. <b>Merge Sort:</b> Divide, sort, and merge. Time Complexity- O(nlogn): Worst/Average/Best Case, Space Complexity- O(n).

5. <b>Quick Sort:</b> Pick a pivot & place it in the correct position in the sorted array, smaller on the left and larger on the right. Time Complexity- O(nlogn): Worst/Average/Best Case, Space Complexity- O(1).

## 🔍 Searching

1. <b>Binary Search:</b> It is an effective algorithm that finds a target value in a <u>sorted array</u> dividing the search algorithm in half, comparing the middle element to the target, and eliminating the half that cannot have it. Time Complexity- O(logn)

2. <b>Lower Bound:</b> Smallest index such that arr[index]>=target

3. <b>Upper Bound:</b> Smallest index such that arr[index]>target
