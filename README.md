## 🔢 Sorting

#### 1. Selection Sort: Select minimum and swap. Time Complexity- O(n2): Worst/Average/Best Case.

#### 2. Bubble Sort: Push the maximum to last by adjacent swapping. Time Complexity- O(n2): Worst/Average Case, O(n): Best Case.

#### 3. Insertion Sort: Takes an element and place it in its correct position. Time Complexity- O(n2): Worst/Average Case, O(n): Best Case.

#### 4. Merge Sort: Divide, sort, and merge. Time Complexity- O(nlogn): Worst/Average/Best Case, Space Complexity- O(n).

#### 5. Quick Sort: Pick a pivot & place it in the correct position in the sorted array, smaller on the left and larger on the right. Time Complexity- O(nlogn): Worst/Average/Best Case, Space Complexity- O(1).
